      ## dxMagic $VERSION attribute attin watch folder ##   

dxMagic insert takes attribute data from attribute.txt or attribute.xlsx formatted files,
then inserts this back into the originating dxf file, similar to using ACADs ATTIN tool.

Valid .txt and .xlsx files found in this folder will be processed and merged back into the originating .dxf file.
The attribute metadata is replaced in the matching .dxf file, if found in $dx_insert.
attout.txt files can be imported back into the originating drawing with the ATTIN command.
The original file is then moved to $dx_pass or $dx_fail folder as appropriate.
Files without txt and xlsx extensions will be ignored (including this readme.txt).

ATTIN is part of the Express Tools found in Full ACAD (or via the menu, Express > Blocks > Import Attribute Information).

# ignoring 0 & 100 code and in this order of precedence
# HANDLE: (DOUBLE SPACE) 0, INSERT, (DOUBLE SPACE) 5, <HANDLE ENTITY H_xxxx>,
# BLOCKNAME: 100, AcDbBlockReference, (DOUBLE SPACE) 2, <BLOCKNAME> ,

# Beware AcDbAttribute comes before the 1, VALUE in a AUTO dxx and before the 2, TAG KEY in a PROG:
# AUTO DXX TAGS: 100, AcDbAttribute, (DOUBLE SPACE) 1,<TAG VALUE>,  (DOUBLE SPACE) 2, <TAG KEY>,
# PROG DXX & AUTO DXF TAGS: (DOUBLE SPACE) 1,<TAG VALUE>,  100, AcDbAttribute, (DOUBLE SPACE) 2, <TAG KEY>,
# So for both  using ATTRIB, (DOUBLE SPACE) 5, (DOUBLE SPACE) 1,<TAG VALUE>, (DOUBLE SPACE) 2, <TAG KEY>, instead of using AcDBAttribute
# ATTRIB, (DS)5, is followed by an incremented handel in dxx and an incremented handel then 330,<INSERT_HANDEL> in dxf, 330 is a pointer to the owner object

# TODOs #  process BLOCK (DS)5, AcDbBlockBegin or set state higher for AcDbBlockBegin and others ...
# set state to something higher (try BLOCKNAME) for AcDblockBegin, AcDbBlockTableRecord, AcDbDimStyleTableRecord, AcDbSymbolTableRecord preceed (DS)2
# use ATTRIB, (DS)5, instead of AcDbAttribute & allow for TAG before VALUE by having a $state VALUE OR $state TAG condition
# Capture Document $TITLE, (DS)1, <Drawing Tilte>
# Capture layout (viewport) tabs LAYOUT, (DS)5, AcDbLayout, (DS)1, <Layout Tag name>

# Only capturing one value, key pair so far ... use $ state to specifiy the actual match variable next required.

# Also looking for the dxf version (not present in a dxx)
# VERSION:  (DOUBLE SPACE) 9, $ACADVER, <VERSION CODE>,

# THINGS TO IGNORE:
# AcDb* (anything other than AcDbBlockReference), (DS) 2 may be problematic
# AcDbBlockBegin, (DS) 2,  DONT TAKE THIS VALUE
# BLOCK_RECORD, (DS), (DS) 5, This is followed by group codes for graphical block entities that can be ingnored, earler in file along with AcDbBlockTableRecord
# AcDbField is a default constructor in dxf with ..1 ..2 coded content that is not attribute releated,
# set state to FIELD to prevent further processing until next INSERT
# AcDbBlockBegin, (DOUBLE SPACE), 2, can be blockname or *Model_Space or *Paper_Space, then there is a (DS) 1 before the next INSERT, so dont start INSERT before -- wait for INSERT ... do this first
# AcDbBlockTableRecord, (DOUBLE SPACE) 2,

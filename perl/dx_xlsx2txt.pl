      ## dxMagic xlsx to txt $VERSION watch folder ##   

dxMagic xlsx to txt takes dxMagic extracted xlsx then creates a tab deliminated attout.txt file, 
matching the format of ACADs ATTOUT tool.

Valid xlsx files found in this folder will be processed to create attout.txt metadata files.
These are written to $dx_attin, with the same file name but given a new .txt extension.
attout.txt files can be imported back into the originating drawing with the ATTIN command.
The source file is then moved to $dx_pass or $dx_fail folder as appropriate.

Files without xlsx extensions will be ignored.

ATTIN is part of the Express Tools found in Full ACAD (or via the menu, Express > Blocks > Import Attribute Information).
